Missing:

- icon-star-half (half of star, half filled star)
- icon-th-large (thumbnails large)
- icon-ok-circle
- icon-tagS (multiple)
- icon-email (not filled)
- icon-vynil == CD ?
- icon-videocam - for video chats/records (facetime)
- icon-filter
- icon-pin
- icon-thumb-down
- icon-picture - there are multiple images (good for album), but no single one
- icon-shopping-cart - too similar to icon-trash & icon-archive,
    may be good to have more "classic" alternative
- icon-zoom-in, icon-zoom-out
- icon-headphones
- icon-login
- icon-logout
- icon-eject
- icon-chart-bar, icon-chart-pie
- more "classic" archive (similar to box, for zip/rar/... archives)
- icon-refresh (round with 2 arrows, similar to retweet)
- icons for progress animation via CSS3 effects (rotation and other)

Notes:

- icon-back-alt - arrow too small
- icon-back - arrow seems small, very weak pressure on movement direction
- icon-doc - unclear (screen/tablet?)
- icon-battery - electro hotdog
- icon-lamp - may be, should be complemented with unfilled one
- icon-progress-* - miss [progress-1, progress-2], flipped horisontally
- icon-comment
  - tail too small, bad looking on small sizes
  - more "light" alternative needed (unfilled siluette), and the same for chat
- icon-list-add - what for ? is just "+" not enougth ?
- icon-google-circles - missplaced, should be with other logos
- icon-inbox - unclear
